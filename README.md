Project: Duality Dice for 5e
Purpose: Introduce a system similar to the duality dice from daggerhear to a dnd5e game. Adds a comparison mechanic to d20 rolls without altering 5e math.

Mechanics:

Trigger: Every d20 roll (HOPE die) triggers an automatic second roll (FEAR die).

Comparison Logic:

Hope: d20 > Fear Die.

Fear: d20 < Fear Die.

Chaos: d20 == Fear Die.

Output: Prints the result (Hope, Fear, or Chaos) to the chat log.

Resource Tracking: Fear and Hope tracked automatically.

Fear Counter: A movable, global UI box visible to all; GM can manually edit the value.

Hope Counter: * Requires a feature named "Hope" on the player's character sheet.
